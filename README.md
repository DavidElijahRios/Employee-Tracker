  ## Description

  
   I wanted to be able utilize my knowledge of using a database to create a CMS to better get a clear understanding on how databases can be utilized in applications.
   It helps with not having to used local storage to keep information that can be easily obtainable but rather in a more secured area and also providing easier access to data to be used by user and for that data to be updated upon user use.
   I see the reason why the use of a database is a powerful tool in developing applications for user experience as well as on how the application functions.

  ## Installation
  

  1) I needed to first initialize my package.json in command line with command npm init -y. 2) Next I installed all necessary packages that I would be using and used following command on command line to bring in packages npm i inquirer --save mysql2 console.table which in turned created my package-lock.json file. 3) I created the necessary folders I would need to organize all code such as db,lib and src folders. 4) lastly I created my db schema and created database in order to have application function. 
  



  ## Usage
  

  1) first you will need to clone repository. 2) Once you have clone then you will go ahead and go into where that clone lives through your terminal and once in the proper directory you will run in your command line the command npm i to install all the necessary packages. 3) Then you will run command node index.js which will then trigger the application and link up to the locally created database.
